Test Plan:
- tested with the try catch blocks in the constructors and some methods, allowing any exceptions to be thrown to inform the user of thier mistake
- use the terminal to test correctness of values going to GUI

The test focuses on the major components of the program and to see if the program is running as expected, the terminal is used to
print out the expected results of each action the user does. This is to see if the there's a problem with the GUI implementation or the
actual functionality of a segment of code. 

this includes:
- the program only accepts the correct formatting for productID, descriptions, year inputs and allows the user to input the correct format
- the search coditions such that:
    - the given element is not on the list
    - the given element is at the start of the list
    - the given element is at the end of the list
    - the given element is somewhere on the list
    - the given description is on the list but the given year/product id is not on the list

- check for if the file reading and writing are working at the start and end of the program (printed to the terminal and additional window pop-up for errors in writing to file)
